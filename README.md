# Lorehelper
**WoW Classic addon for lore lovers**

[Some screenshots to give you an idea](https://imgur.com/a/yX1oiAL)

**What Lorehelper does**:
- Guides you through the **lore of your race** via a "lore test". Standard questions are: age of your character, home Kingdom/Clan/whatever, and then a few questions about the character's participation in the important events. It's all highly race-specific, and won't contain nonsense like "did your troll fight in War of the Three Hammers". First War etc for humans, War of the Ancients etc for night elves, conflict with Theramore for tauren - nothing you wouldn't guess.
- Guides you through the **lore of world areas** via Zonepedia (TM). Just pick a zone and read briefly about it; usually perspectives of different races are available. Additionally, info about the zones that are important for your race will pop up as soon as you enter the zone.

**Future features/improvements**:
- Add some texts (e.g. gnome mage may want a mention of that gnome who was in the very Council of Tirisfal).
- Improve the texts (that's a massive one, a lot of texts lack artistry and even grammar).
- At the moment, if your character is too young to participate in an event, they're not getting a mention of the event in the "lore test". I made it with the idea of relevance (why would 100-years-old night elf youngling care about War of the Satyr), but now I feel that too much lore is being missed by those whose character is young (100-years-old dwarf might still be interested in War of the Three Hammers since this even echoes even today). **What do you think?** Should I add a test "question" describing the event with only one "answer" - "I was not born back then"?
- **Dungeonhelper**! Drawing on tremendous work of /u/minorou, I plan to include a way for Lorehelper users to entertain their dungeon party with the lore of the dungeon. See [Minorou's Dungeon Lore Compendium](https://barrens.chat/viewtopic.php?f=17&t=1629). I've been thinking of a "mediaplayer" that a Lorehelper user clicks in order to send a paragraph of dungeon history to the party chat. Of course, the first paragraph would always be like "do you guys want to read some lore, or do you want me to stop". I am not sure if I'll be able to handle the boss lore in the same way without making the addon too difficult to use. **What do you think?** Any ideas on how to incorporate the dungeon lore in an efficient way are welcome.

I hope those interested in lore will find the Lorehelper addon fun to use. Any ideas/suggestions/complaints welcome.
