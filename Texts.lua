You may also receieve some tips about quests you should not miss.|n|nIn situations when the official lore is uncertain, I tried to come up with the most sensible solution. For example, we do not know when dwarves normally become old, but since Muradin Bronzebeard was 221 years old during the Third War, I came up with a guesstimate of 500 as a \"maximum\" age of a dwarf.|n|nI sincerely apologise to those who wanted to RP a 501-years-old dwarf, as well as to anyone who find the \"test\" limiting.|n|nHuge thanks to Wowpedia and WoWWiki authors for immensive efforts on lore collection. Thanks to Arctium team for creating a great sandbox that allowed me to make and test the addon. And, of course, to Blizzard for inventing this wonderful World!|n|nYours,|nNimeral"
	--Another example is, it is unclear when Darkspear trolls were driven from Stranglethorn, the addon supposes it is after the Second War when an ogre-mage was more likely to roam around Azeroth, seeking a troll tribe to seize their land.
